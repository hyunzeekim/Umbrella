# Umbrella
Umbrella Inc. is a social enterprise that is bringing a new, innovative, security-based Android application to the market. Our mission is to help all women feel safe and secure. Our app Umbrella will be used to help women feel safe by implementing a check-in system that allows the user to “check in” with the app at regular time intervals in a quick and efficient way: by drawing a shape as their passcode. A lack of check in will notify one of the user’s pre-entered contacts that they missed a check in, and that the user could possibly be in danger.
